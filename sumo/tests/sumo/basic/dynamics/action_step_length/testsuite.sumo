# Test speed adaption when changing to a consecutive lane with lower speed.
# All approaching vehicles should adapt their speed smoothly, non-oscillatingly to the lower speed of the consecutive lane. The last inserted vehicle starts slower than the maximal speed on the consecutive lane, but should not choose an acceleration, which leads to higher speeds than the consecutive lane's maximal speed.
