Warning: The parameter action-step-length must be a non-negative multiple of the simulation step-length. Parsing given value (2.6 s.) to nearest positive multiple (=2.5 s.)
Warning: Given action step length 2.5 for vehicle type 't1' is larger than its parameter tau (=1.5)! This may lead to collisions. (This warning is only issued once per vehicle type).
Warning: The parameter action-step-length must be a non-negative multiple of the simulation step-length. Parsing given value (2.6 s.) to nearest positive multiple (=2.5 s.)
Warning: Given action step length 2.5 for vehicle type 't2@veh2' is larger than its parameter tau (=2)! This may lead to collisions. (This warning is only issued once per vehicle type).
